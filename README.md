## 🔍 Problem Statement
In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

Key Questions Addressed:
- How many loan applications have been received over a specific period?
- What is the total amount funded, and how does it vary over time?
- What percentage of loans are classified as 'Good Loans' versus 'Bad Loans'?
- What are the trends in borrower employment length and home ownership status?
- How do loan purposes and interest rates impact default rates?

This report will serve as a crucial tool for optimizing lending strategies and improving risk assessment.

## 📖 Terminologies Used

The report uses the following key fields for data processing:
